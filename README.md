### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
In this exercise, a compaany has tasked me with the production of an Inventory App. This app should be a simple inventory app that is made to work on android devices. The app should: 
Create a database with at least two tables, one to store the inventory items and one to store user logins and passwords
Create a screen for logging into the app. Note that this should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before.
Create a screen, with a grid, that displays all items in the inventory
Create a mechanism by which the user can add and remove items from inventory
Create a mechanism by which the user can increase or decrease the number of a specific item in the inventory
Create a mechanism by which the application will notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to 0 (zero)

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
With ease of use in mind, I created only a few screens. There is a login screen, a register screen, a retrieve password screen, an add item screen, and the inventory list screen. The inventory list screen also includes a pop up when editing an existing item. The idea behind the amount of screens and their functionality was making sure the user experience was quick and easy. The inventory app is a simple app, and there shouldn't be issues with the functionality that would hinder the quicknes and ease of using the app. 

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The approach to coding the app was straight forward. I had planned out most the functions of the app and I decided to start with the CRUD functionality and develop the SQLite classes first. I felt that doing this meant that testing would go a bit smoother as I could quickly see results on the android Emulator.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Testing mostly ran through the android emulator. I wanted to test if the code was actually functional and the UI at the same time. The android emulator was great in allowing me to do that in real time. 

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I don't think there was any part during the process that I specifically had to innovate. While the app was very straight forward, there were bumps along the way and I belive they were easily tackled due to the amount of resources that are provided. Android provides such a vast library of references and explanations that it made it easy to just search how to fix any issues. 

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think I did a great job knocking out the CRUD functionality fairly quick and applying it throughout the program easily. That is something that I have studied in previous courses, and it is great to see it come into play here.
